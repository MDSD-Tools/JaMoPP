### Just a simple REST backend

Try a GET to this resource:

[http://localhost:8090/weather/general/outlook](http://localhost:8090/weather/general/outlook)

I added the really nice Swaggerfox-UI - just fire up WeatherBackendApplication and go to [http://localhost:8090/swagger-ui.html](http://localhost:8090/swagger-ui.html)
