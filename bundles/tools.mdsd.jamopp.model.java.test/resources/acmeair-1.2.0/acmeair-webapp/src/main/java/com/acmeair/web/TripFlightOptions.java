/**
 * TripFlightOptions is the main return type when searching for flights.
 * 
 * The object will return as many tripLeg's worth of Flight options as requested.  So if the user
 * requests a one way flight they will get a List that has only one TripLegInfo and it will have
 * a list of flights that are options for that flight.  If a user selects round trip, they will
 * have a List of two TripLegInfo objects.  If a user does a multi-leg flight then the list will
 * be whatever size they requested.  For now, only supporting one way and return flights so the
 * list should always be of size one or two.
