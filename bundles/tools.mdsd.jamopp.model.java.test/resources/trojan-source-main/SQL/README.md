# SQL

## Instructions

These POCs can be executed using the following command:
```sh
python3 commenting-out.py
```
where `commenting-out` is substituted for the relevant POC. Vulnerable code viewers for reviewing the source code can be found in the [parent README](https://github.com/nickboucher/trojan-source#code-viewers).

Note that the SQL commands are wrapped in a Python driver to increase portability.
