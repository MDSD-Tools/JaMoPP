# Solidity

## Instructions

Rather than building a local Solidity dev environment, we recommend compiling these POC's using [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org), an online IDE for Solidity provided by Etherium. To compile using this IDE, copy the desired POC from thsi directory to the Remix editor, select a vulnerable compiler, and click "Compile". Transactions can then be simulated by selecting the related tab to validate vulnerability.
