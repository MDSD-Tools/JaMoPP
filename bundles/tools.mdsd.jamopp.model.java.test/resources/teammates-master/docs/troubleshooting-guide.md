## Troubleshooting test failures

### Common test errors and solutions

* **ERROR**: Encountered `java.net.ConnectException: Connection refused` when running E2E tests.

  **SOLUTION**: Ensure that your dev server is started prior to running those tests.

* **ERROR**: Encountered `org.openqa.selenium.WebDriverException: Unable to bind to locking port 7054 within 45000 ms` when running tests with Browser.

  **SOLUTION**: Ensure compatible version of Firefox is installed as specified under [Development process document](development.md#testing).

* **ERROR**: Test failure message encountered when running full test suite: "Selenium cannot find Firefox binary in PATH".

  **REASON 1**: Path to Firefox executable on local machine is incorrect.

  **SOLUTION 1 (on Windows)**: Specify the correct folder in system PATH variable.

  Open Windows Explorer → Right-click on Computer → Advanced System Settings → "Advanced" tab → Environment Variables… → Select "PATH" from the list → Add directory of "Mozilla Firefox" folder to "Variable value" field.

  **REASON 2**: Incorrect custom path in `test.firefox.path`.

  **SOLUTION 2**: Make sure that the path is set correctly following the example from `test.template.properties`.

* **ERROR**: A handful of failed test cases (< 10).

  **SOLUTION**: Re-run the failed tests with TestNG, all test cases should pass eventually (it may take a few runs). If there are tests that persistently fail and not addressed in other parts of this guide, you may [request for help in the issue tracker](https://github.com/TEAMMATES/teammates/issues/new?template=help-request.md).

* **ERROR**: Tests fail due to accented characters.

  **SOLUTION**: Ensure that the text file encoding for your workspace has been set to `UTF-8` as specified under [Setting up guide](setting-up.md).

* **ERROR (on Linux)**: `java.io.IOException: Directory "/tmpfiles" could not be created`.

   **SOLUTION**: Add `-Djava.io.tmpdir=/path/to/teammates/tmp` for the tests' run configurations. The "tmp" folder in the specified directory needs to be created before running the tests.
