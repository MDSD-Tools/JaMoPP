# Glossary

This document lines out the common terms used in the project.

## Product-related

+ **Course**: We use "course" to mean "module", "class". A course here means an offering of a course in a particular semester/term. If the course is offered twice in two semesters (i.e. with different students and teaching team), they are considered two courses. There is, however, no time limit on how long a course may run.
+ **Contribution scale**:
```
    [equal share]+100%

    [equal share]+90%

    ...

    [equal share]

    [NOT SURE]

    [equal share]-10%

     ...

    [equal share]-90%

    [0%] (did nothing at all)
```
+ **Enrollment, Enroll** (NOT enrolment, enrol).
+ **Feedback Session**: A collection of questions for students and/or instructors alike to answer; synonymous to a questionnaire, a survey.<br>
  Sometimes, this is referred to as simply "Session"; developers must take extra care so as not to confuse it with HTTP sessions.
