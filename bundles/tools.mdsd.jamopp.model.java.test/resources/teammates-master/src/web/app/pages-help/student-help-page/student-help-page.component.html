    Getting Started
  </h4>

  <ol>
    <li>
      <b>Join the course</b> by clicking the link given in the email you received from TEAMMATES.<br>
      Note that you need to join a course only once per course.<br>
      Also note that joining a course is optional. If you do not join, you can still submit feedback and view feedback
      responses using links sent to you by TEAMMATES. If you join, you get access to extra features such as the ability
      to see all your feedback sessions in a single home page.<br>
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Do the pending submissions</b> (if any).<br>
      You will need to <b>use the "Submit Feedback" button</b> in order to submit your responses
      (including any intermediate/draft responses) as the system will not perform any kind of auto-save.
    </li>
    <li>You can <b>edit your submissions</b> up to the closing time of the respective session.</li>
    <li>You can <b>view session results</b> after the instructor has published session results. The system will notify
      you via email when results are available for viewing.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <b>What should I do if I cannot see any/some of my courses I should be able to see in the system?</b>
      <div>
        These are the possible reasons:
        <ol>
          <li>
            You used a different Google account to access TEAMMATES in the past.
            In that case, you need to use the same Google account to access TEAMMATES again.
            Logout and re-login using the other Google account.
          </li>
          <li>
            You changed the primary email from a non-Gmail address to a Gmail address recently.
            In that case, email <a href="mailto:{{ supportEmail }}">{{ supportEmail }}</a> so that we can
            reconfigure your account to use the new Gmail address.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </div>
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>What should I do if I'm unable to submit my response?</b>
      <div>
        <a href="mailto:{{ supportEmail }}">Email us</a> so that we can assist you with your submission.
        Note that we cannot do much if the submission deadline is over. It is not up to us (the TEAMMATES team) to
        accept overdue submissions.
