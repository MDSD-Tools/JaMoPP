# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We actively support BigBlueButton through the community forums and through security updates.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 2.0.x (or earlier)  | :x:                |
| 2.2.x   | :x:  |
| 2.3.x   | :white_check_mark: |

We have released 2.3 to the community and all our support efforts are now transitioned to 2.3.  Also, BigBlueButton 2.2 is running on Ubuntu 16.04 which is now end of life.

As such, we highly recommend that all administrators deploy 2.3 going forward as it is built upon Ubuntu 18.04.  You'll find [many improvements](/2.3/new.html) in this newer version.
