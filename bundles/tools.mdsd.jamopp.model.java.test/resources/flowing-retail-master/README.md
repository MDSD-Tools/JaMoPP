# Flowing Retail

This sample application demonstrates a simple order fulfillment system, decomposed into multiple independent components (like _microservices_).

The repository contains code for multiple implementation alternatives to allow a broad audience to understand the code and to compare alternatives. The [table below](#alternatives) lists these alternatives.

The example respects learnings from **Domain Driven Design (DDD)**, Event Driven Architecture (EDA) and **Microservices (ÂµS)** and is designed to give you hands-on access to these topics.

**Note:** The code was written in order to be explained. Hence, I favored simplified code or copy & paste over production-ready code with generic solutions. **Don't consider the coding style best practice! It is purpose-written to be easily explainable code**.

You can find more information on the concepts in the [Practical Process Automation](https://processautomationbook.com/) book with O'Reilly.

## Architecture and implementation alternatives

The most fundamental choice is to select the **communication mechanism**:

* **[Apache Kafka](kafka/)** as event bus (could be easily changed to messaging, e.g. RabbitMQ): [](docs/architecture.png)
* **[REST](rest/)** communication between Services.
  * This example also shows how to do **stateful resilience patterns** like **stateful retries** leveraging a workflow engine.
* **[Zeebe](zeebe/)** broker doing work distribution.

After the communication mechanism, the next choice is the **workflow engine**:

* **Camunda 8 (aka Zeebe)**

and the **programming language**:

* **Java**

## Storyline

Flowing retail simulates a very easy order fulfillment system. The business logic is separated into the services shown above (shown as a [context map](https://www.infoq.com/articles/ddd-contextmapping)).

### Long running services and orchestration

Some services are **long running** in nature - for example: the payment service asks customers to update expired credit cards. A workflow engine is used to persist and control these long running interactions.

### Workflows live within service boundaries

Note that the state machine (_or workflow engine in this case_) is a library used **within** one service. If different services need a workflow engine they can  run whatever engine they want. This way it is an autonomous team decision if they want to use a framework, and which one:
